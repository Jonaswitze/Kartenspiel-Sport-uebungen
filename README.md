# Kartenspiel-Sport-uebungen

Hey guys, this is our program for our PE teacher. According to its configuration,
the program shows random sports exercises in random repetition rates.
Please note that you have to configure the settings before you can use the program.
You have the possibility to configure up to 4 exercises in free text.
You can also set the number of total repetitions. 
At the end there is the possibility to configure the number of possible repetitions per round. 
When you have carried out the configuration, which, by the way, remains saved when the program is closed,
you can click on "Start". You can get to the next exercise via the "Next" button.

If you have any questions, please write to us.

Btw: That is a fun project whose existence can only be justified by boredom. Understand that the code quality is not particularly good.
